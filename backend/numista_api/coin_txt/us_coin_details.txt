After a difficult youth, running away from school after several family crises, Thorpe came into his own at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Although the residential Indian school had a mixed reputation, Carlisle then had the services of one of the great early football coaches, Glenn Scobey “Pop” Warner and it fielded a national championship football team, led by Thorpe. At the time Thorpe was the core of the school’s track and field team, also coached by Warner, and the story is that Warner was reluctant to let his track star run the risk of playing football.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThorpe was named to the All-American first team in 1911 and 1912. In 1911, Carlisle upset Harvard 18-15, as Thorpe scored all its points, four field goals and a touchdown. In 1912, Carlisle won the national collegiate championship.

In an often-told story, King Gustav V of Sweden, presenting Thorpe a special decathlon award, told him, “You are the greatest athlete in the world,” and Thorpe replied, “Thanks, king.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThorpe then embarked on an incredibly varied career with the public flocking to his professional appearances in football, baseball and basketball. He played for six teams in what later became the National Football League. In 1922, he became the first president of the American Professional Football Association, precursor of the NFL. In baseball, he played for the New York Giants, the Cincinnati Reds and the Boston Braves. He also organized an all-Indian football team, reuniting some Carlisle players.

After the initial distribution, legislation was passed in Congress stipulating that the original design should be supplemented by adding the bicentennial year “1934” to the obverse of the coin.
