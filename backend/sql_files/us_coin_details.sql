After Mankiller returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1977, she founded the Community Development Department for the Cherokee Nation. She led the creation of community water systems and rehabilitation of houses during the administration of Principal Chief Ross Swimmer. In 1983, Swimmer named Mankiller his running mate in his bid for re-election. When they won, Mankiller became the first woman elected deputy chief of the Cherokee Nation. After Swimmer left office to lead the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, she became principal chief. Mankiller was elected chief in 1987, and four years later, re-elected in a landslide. She tripled her tribe’s enrollment, doubled employment, and built new housing, health centers, and children’s programs in northeast Oklahoma. Under her leadership, infant mortality declined and educational levels rose. Her leadership on social and financial issues made her tribe a national role model. After leaving office in 1995, she remained a strong voice worldwide for social justice, native people, and women.

After a difficult youth, running away from school after several family crises, Thorpe came into his own at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Although the residential Indian school had a mixed reputation, Carlisle then had the services of one of the great early football coaches, Glenn Scobey “Pop” Warner and it fielded a national championship football team, led by Thorpe. At the time Thorpe was the core of the school’s track and field team, also coached by Warner, and the story is that Warner was reluctant to let his track star run the risk of playing football. Thorpe was named to the All-American first team in 1911 and 1912. In 1911, Carlisle upset Harvard 18-15, as Thorpe scored all its points, four field goals and a touchdown. In 1912, Carlisle won the national collegiate championship. It beat Army 27-6; a cadet named Dwight D. Eisenhower injured his knee trying to tackle Thorpe. In 1912, Thorpe represented the U. S. at the Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, competing in the new Pentathlon and Decathlon as well as two field events. He easily won both multi-event medals, finishing first in eight of the combined 15 events. His point record stood for two decades. In an often-told story, King Gustav V of Sweden, presenting Thorpe a special decathlon award, told him, “You are the greatest athlete in the world,” and Thorpe replied, “Thanks, king.” Thorpe then embarked on an incredibly varied career with the public flocking to his professional appearances in football, baseball and basketball. He played for six teams in what later became the National Football League. In 1922, he became the first president of the American Professional Football Association, precursor of the NFL. In baseball, he played for the New York Giants, the Cincinnati Reds and the Boston Braves. He also organized an all-Indian football team, reuniting some Carlisle players. Today, sports writers rank him at the top of their lists of greatest athletes of the 20th Century.');

Gerber created a rubber rule and scale that could flow with a curve, expand, contract, and turn a corner. It allowed for the direct numerical reading of curves, graphs, and graphical representations. Because of its ease of use and quick solutions, the Gerber Variable Scale was a huge success, and by the 1950s, it was considered the universally accepted tool for engineers and architects all over the world.');

Both the obverse and reverse were designed by Juliette May Fraser, a painter, muralist, and printmaker born in Honolulu, with modeling done by Chester Beach. The Hawaiian Sesquicentennial Half Dollar was authorized with a maximum mintage of just 10,000 pieces, a mere fraction of the level typical for commemorative coins of this era. Distribution was performed by the Captain Cook Sesquicentennial Commission through the Bank of Hawaii at an issue price of $2 per coin. Despite the fact that the issue price was double the usual level, sales were swift and the issue sold out. Originally, it was intended that half the mintage would be sold to Hawaiian residents and half to the mainland, but the majority of sales occurred to Hawaiians. A combination of the low mintage and distribution primarily to non-collectors helped this issue achieve an instant premium over the issue price.

These coins were conceived and planned by the Westchester County Coin Club of New Rochelle, New York. Initially, Lorrilard Wise was engaged to prepare the designs for the coin. Her first models featured a Native American crouching in the grass and watching a boat carry settlers to the shore on the obverse and the city seal on the reverse. The Commission of Fine Arts rejected the designs, recommending changes, which were executed and also rejected. Eventually, Gertrude Lathrop, who had designed the 1936 Albany Half Dollar, was engaged to prepare new designs for the New Rochelle Half Dollar. Her obverse design would depict John Pell and a fatted calf, which recalls the sale of the original land upon which the city now stands. One of the conditions of the sale was for Pell or his heirs to receive a fatted calf each year on June 24. The reverse design features the fleur-de-lis, taken from the seal of the city. Similar to the obverse, the single design element is presented in a flat and open field with sharply contrasting lettering. Authorizing legislation provided that the coins should be dated 1938, without regard to when the coins were actually minted, and have a maximum mintage of 25,000 pieces. The Philadelphia Mint struck the entire amount in 1937, which were sold through the New Rochelle Commemorative Coin Committee for $2 each. Eventually, almost 10,000 pieces were returned to the mint for melting, resulting in a small net distribution of 15,266 coins. Authorization: Public Law 74-556');

The Treasury, however, gave "only $2.5 million due to the prevailing hard economic times." DeLorey goes on to say that someone "connected with the Fair Authority got the brilliant idea that if the Treasury would provide the $2.5 million in the form of five million commemorative half dollars," then the Fair would need only "to sell the coins for a dollar each" in order to obtain the extra $2.5 million dollars needed. Because of hard economic times, however, "only a few hundred thousand were sold at the premium, the rest were either released into circulation at face value or melted."

To narrow the gender gap in science and engineering careers, Ride and O’Shaughnessy started an education company to inspire young people, especially girls, in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). In 2001, they joined like-minded friends with expertise in physics, administration, and technology to found Sally Ride Science. One of Ride’s goals in starting the Sally Ride Science organization was to make sure girls and boys of all backgrounds had access to role models who looked like them. Dr. Ride received many honors during her life, including induction into the Astronaut Hall of Fame, National Women’s Hall of Fame, and Aviation Hall of Fame.');

The distribution took place through local banks, with a vast number sold to the local communities and even more sold throughout New England. Wider demand was a result of the true historical significance of the commemorative issue. Authorization: Public Law 68-43 Maximum Authorized Mintage: 300,000 The coins were packaged in small wooden boxes, which featured images from the obverse and reverse of the Lexington and Concord Sesquicentennial Half Dollar, and originally sold for $1 each.

Only 330,000 were struck while the New Orleans Mint was under the control of the United States of America (USA) government (in January 1861). Another 1,240,000 were struck after Louisiana left the Union (USA), but before they joined the Confederate States of America (CSA). At least one source has indicated that they were struck with the approval/permission of the CSA Government. 962,633 were struck after Louisiana joined the CSA. Since the coins were struck with U.S. Mint dies, to the standards of USA coins (and using the same staff that had worked for the Mint under USA control), the USA decided to permit the coins to remain in circulation after the Civil War (war between the USA and the CSA). A sequence of die usage has been researched, which indicates which coins were struck under USA control. On average, only 1 of 8 pieces was minted for the USA. One obverse die used while the New Orleans Mint was operating under the CSA government had a die crack running from Liberty''s nose to the edge. Coins with this crack can be positively attributed to the CSA. This die was also used for one side of the Confederate shield half dollars.');

The obverse featured a three quarter profile portrait of Booker T. Washington behind the profile portrait of George Washington Carver. The reverse featured the American Legion seal with inscriptions including “United Against the Spread of Communism”. The revised and later approved models featured both portraits in profile, surrounded by lengthy inscriptions.

Prices were $9 or $10 per set, and later $12 per set for the 1954 coins. In 1952, there was some attempt to issue the coins broadly through banks, but many were eventually distributed at or near face value. By the end of the program, more than one million coins would be distributed. For nearly three decades, no additional commemorative coins were approved within the United States.

USPatterns.com notes that the former Bass example in silver, reeded edge (Judd-1154), weighed 410 grains--close to the regular standard for silver dollars, despite the reverse inscription. The use of the revised motto GOD OUR TRUST is interesting, as this original version had been rejected years before, and "no information has been learned to the effect that the usual motto, IN GOD WE TRUST, needed modification," according to Judd. Perhaps the simplest explanation is correct, that for the designer a ribbon center with two sides dictated a three- rather than four-word version. Judd estimates that the plain edge versions in silver and copper are R.8, while the reeded edge versions are High R.7. Like so many of these incredibly elusive patterns, however, making an accurate census or estimate of their true rarity is simply impossible. Many of the early auction citations lack photographs and/or are simply misattributed--when attributed at all--and various factors conspire to mask the true picture of a given issue''s rarity.

The TVA built 16 hydroelectric dams in the Tennessee Valley between 1933 and 1944. Through the power of the TVA projects, Tennessee quickly became the nation’s largest public utility supplier. The TVA organized an experimental farmer-owned rural electric cooperative to serve the area around Tupelo, Mississippi. The cooperative succeeded, and the federal government created a special agency dedicated solely to rural electrification, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA).

The Dr. Sally Ride Quarter is the second coin in the American Women Quarters™ Program. Dr. Sally Ride was a physicist, astronaut, educator, and the first American woman to soar into space. When she blasted off aboard Space Shuttle Challenger on June 18, 1983, Ride became the first American woman – and, at 32, the youngest American – in space. During the six days of mission STS-7, she deployed and retrieved a satellite with the shuttle’s robotic arm. Her second shuttle flight, STS-41G, made history as the first space mission with two female crew members. After her historic spaceflight, Ride saw that her example was a powerful tool for inspiring young people, especially girls, to pursue careers in science. She teamed up with Tam O’Shaughnessy to write six science books for young people. “The Third Planet: Exploring the Earth from Space,” won the American Institute of Physics’ Children’s Science Writing Award in 1995. To narrow the gender gap in science and engineering careers, Ride and O’Shaughnessy started an education company to inspire young people, especially girls, in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). In 2001, they joined like-minded friends with expertise in physics, administration, and technology to found Sally Ride Science. One of Ride’s goals in starting the Sally Ride Science organization was to make sure girls and boys of all backgrounds had access to role models who looked like them. Dr. Ride received many honors during her life, including induction into the Astronaut Hall of Fame, National Women’s Hall of Fame, and Aviation Hall of Fame.');
